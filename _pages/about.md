Hello, I'm **Yuseon Choi**, an M.S. student at _KAIST_, where I conduct research on AI accelerators at [SSL](https://ssl.kaist.ac.kr) under Prof. [Hoi-Jun Yoo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=92lpdnsAAAAJ&hl=en), working primarily with Prof. [Sangjin Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ScgPYbQAAAAJ&hl=en). 

## Biography

I received my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from _KAIST_ in 2024, and am currently pursuing my master’s degree. Previously, I was a research intern at _Samsung Research_, advised by Former Fellow [Guyeon Wei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IR0yJB8AAAAJ&hl=en), and served in _Republic of Korea Marine Corps (ROKMC)_ for 1.5 years.

## Research Interest

My research focuses on **digital accelerators** and **hardware–algorithm co-design** for generative AI. I have worked on efficient LLM inference across the stack, from architecture-level optimizations to silicon-verified implementation:
- Quantization-driven, energy-efficient NPU design
- System-level architecting for on-premises AI deployment  

Looking forward, I am interested in extending this holistic approach to accelerate emerging AI workloads at scale in deployable systems.

## Vision

I aspire to take on new challenges to fulfill my vision of **_bringing new experiences and inspiration to humanity_**.
Thank you for taking an interest in my journey — more to come.
